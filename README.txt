So I basically made this because I was bored. I liked watching thousands of files get deleted, so I made this to make them for me. Version 2 was made so I could "send some files" (my exact words) to my friends. I also made V2 because V1 was trash and slow. Version 2 is so much faster. I made Version 3 so I could copy existing files, such as cringe images, and send a bunch of them to my friends. Next update will probably be the addition of custom text inside the files, becuase as in the current state, the best letter, 'E', is used to fill the files.
